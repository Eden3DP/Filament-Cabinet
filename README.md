# FAQ
Q: What is the Eden3D Filament Cabinet?
---

Q: What does the Filament Cabinet do?
---
A: This filament cabinet can properly store your material in a climate-controlled enviroment, keeping your filament dry and ready to go anytime you want to start printing. It also contains a battery-backup system, which can be connected to your Eden I 3D Printer for off-grid power consumption. 

Q: What is the purpose of the Filament Cabinet?
---
A: The main purpose of this device is to not only store your material in a dry, ready-to-use enviroment, but this is also a back-up system to consume power to continue to 3D print, in case extra power is needed, grid power goes off, and/or you'd like to use this machine in a remote location setting. All glass cabinet doors make it easy to view which material you'd like to use for your next build.

Q: How stupid. Why would I want a battery backup in my filament cabinet!?
---

This was designed by us, for us. We are simply sharing it with the world and excited to recieve any feedback to make the proper improvments where necessary in upcoming versions.
